ML-GA Framework for Designing Lightweight BCC Multi-Principal Element Alloys for Hydrogen Storage

This repository contains the datasets, machine-learning (ML) model scripts, and metaheuristic genetic-algorithm (GA) framework developed for the paper:

“Design of Lightweight BCC Multi-Principal Element Alloys with Enhanced Hydrogen Storage Using a Machine-Learning-Driven Genetic Algorithm”
DOI: 10.1039/d5ta06903c

This project demonstrates a machine-learning-assisted genetic-algorithm (ML-GA) framework for the accelerated discovery of body-centered-cubic (BCC) multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs) with improved hydrogen storage performance.

The ML models predict H/M ratios, (de)hydrogenation enthalpy, bulk modulus, and phase stability, while the GA performs high-throughput compositional optimization across the {Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Nb, Mo} elemental space.
